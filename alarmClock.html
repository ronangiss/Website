	<h3>Introduction</h3>
	<p>&emsp;&emsp;The Model WT-5720 La Crosse Technology Alarm Clock was an old alarm clock of my mom's. Like most digital alarm clocks, it displayed the time and allowed alarms to be set at certain times using a small LCD screen. The outstanding features of this alarm clock though were its radio controlled time and ability to display the time on the ceiling using a projection unit. The benefit of the projection unit is clear as it allows one to check the time while laying in bed simply by opening one's eyes. However, I had not heard about the concept of radio controlled time before. I've included a paragraph below from the product manual on how the clock uses radio controlled time.</p>
	<br>
	<p>&emsp;&emsp;<i>The NIST (National Institute of Standards and Technology—Time and Frequency Division) WWVB radio station is located in Ft. Collins, Colorado, and transmits the exact time signal continuously throughout the United States at 60 kHz.  The signal can be received up to 2,000 miles away through the internal antenna in the projection alarm. However, due to the nature of the Earth’s Ionosphere, reception is very limited during daylight hours. The projection alarm will search for a signal every night when reception is best. The WWVB radio station derives its signal from the NIST Atomic clock in Boulder, Colorado. A team of atomic physicists is continually measuring every second, of every day, to an accuracy of ten billionths of a second per day. These physicists have created an international standard, measuring a second as 9,192,631,770 vibrations of a Cesium-133 atom in a vacuum.</i></p>
	<br>
	<p>&emsp;&emsp;It's fascinating to learn how the measurement of time is unified across the nation. The unification of time is particularly important in the modern era as it helps people hundreds of miles away from each other schedule times to communicate.</p>
