			<h3>Introduction</h3>
			<p>&emsp;&emsp;This project was completed as part of my electronics class during the fall semester of my junior year at Tufts. The project requirement was to create an electromechanical game that included some user input using an electronic device and moving mechanical elements controlled electronically. I decided to build a small goalie robot that could rotate his arms to block shots on a soccer goal.</p>

			<h3>Design</h3>
			<p>The electronic inputs used in this design include:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>2 Buttons: One for each arm. Clicking the button sends the corresponding arm of the goalie to its fully raised or fully lowered position alternating between button clicks.</li>
				<li>2 Trimmer Potentiometers: One for each arm. Twisting the knob of the potentiometer allows for gradual adjustments in the positioning of the corresponding arm of the goalie.</li>
			</ul>
			<p>The mechanical outputs used in this design include:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>2 Hobby Servo Motors: One for each arm. The motors had a full range of 180 degrees, but only a range of 80 degrees was used for the robot since the long goalie arms would otherwise have hit the ground.</li>
			</ul>
