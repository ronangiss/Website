			<h2>Hi there!</h2>
			<p>My name is Rónán Gissler and I'm currently a third-year undergraduate at Tufts University where I am studying mechanical engineering.</p> 
			<p>This website serves to share my projects with others. I hope you pick up something useful here or that you find my projects entertaining.<p>
			<p>This website has three project categories: </p>
			<ul>
				<li>Teardowns</li>
				<li>Automatons</li>
				<li>Electronics</li>
			</ul>
			<p>Through each field I have learned different lessons in mechanical engineering. Through tearing down and documenting what goes into manufactured products, I've learned from a wide array of examples of professional engineering design. By designing and constructing automatons, I've grown familar with CAD modeling, 3D printing, and mechanical elements in engineering design. Through assembling small circuits run with microcontrollers, I've become comfortable with a variety of electronic systems and enhanced my skills in software programming.</p>
