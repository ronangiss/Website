	<h3>Introduction</h3>
	<p>&emsp;&emsp;The Model A-13 Sunbeam Dry Iron was yet another device my grandma sent over to me for repair. Having seen the last device she sent over, her desk lamp, broken further rather than repaired, she was prepared to part with the iron when she gave it to me. My grandma had been using the iron since the 1970s and preferred how manageable it felt in her hand unlike the larger contemporary steam irons. However, recently she had noticed that the temperature control switch wasn't working correctly. The iron was always running hot even when the temperature adjustment knob was set to 'off'. This made it difficult to iron linens as one had to be careful not to burn the fabric. Unlike the lamp, this story is one of great success with the iron returned to full working condition.</p>

	<p>&emsp;&emsp;Compared to previous teardowns, the iron was one of the most challenging products I've disassembled. The fasteners securing components together were well hidden on the product and the handle, shell, and sole plate were connected together with a hidden press fit connection. As a result, the iron required careful inspection and prodding to disassemble it in a nondestructive manner. During this inspection, I noticed that the patent numbers for the iron were inscribed on the heel plate. Looking up the three patent numbers on the US Patent Database, I found files relating to each patent number. Among the files from these patent numbers, only one document pertained to this exact model. Download the patent document <a href="files/ironPatent3.pdf" download>here</a> or read it below at the end of this webpage (the pdf won't render correctly on mobile devices). The patent proved to be a useful resource in understanding how the iron worked and thus how its failures could be remedied.</p>

	<h3>Repairing the Thermostatic Switch</h3>
	<p>&emsp;&emsp;Since the iron's issue was one of temperature control, I examined the thermostat of the iron in great detail to find out what was wrong. When I initially looked at the temperature adjustment knob from the outside, I assumed the thermostat was as simple as just a potentiometer that acted as a variable resistor controlling the current supplied to the resisitve heating element. However, with the patent dated at 1962, this device was produced before the age of modern microelectronics. In fact, about the only electronic components are wires. The thermostat is nearly completely mechanical. The mechanism has many moving parts, but with some study can be understood and its beauty appreciated.</p>
	<p>&emsp;&emsp;The mechanism begins with a cam, secured to the temperature control knob handle. As the temperature control knob handle is rotated by the user, the cam rotates internally. The cam is made of a circular piece of metal with a sloped ramp along its rim. Resting on this ramp is the head of the cam follower shaft. Rotating the cam causes the cam follower head to slide up or down on the ramp. As a result, the cam follower is pushed down or allowed to rise. When the temperature control knob is initially on the 'off' setting, the cam follower head rests at the bottom of the cam ramp and the cam follower is as high as possible. When the temperature control knob is turned, the cam follower head moves up the cam ramp and the cam follower is lowered.</p>
