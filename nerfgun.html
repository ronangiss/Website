	<p>Disassembling the Raider CS-35 Nerf Gun was the first teardown I took on independently. Earlier during that spring semester in my sophomore year at Tufts, I had walked through a formal teardown of an electric can opener with a team of 3 other students in my Engineering Design class. We disassembled and reassembled the product many times, compiled a bill of materials, modeled all the parts in Solidworks, compared the product with similar competing products, and then presented a final presentation on our analysis of the product. This month long process was much too intensive to be easily repeated on my own time, but it inspired me to disassemble and reassemble other manufactured products.</p>
